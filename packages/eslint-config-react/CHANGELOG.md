# @wesp-up/eslint-config-react

## 2.0.0 (2024-07-27)

### Major Changes

Update ESLint to v9

- This required a lot of changes and some configs/plugins still haven't updated yet, so will have to wait until they do (e.g. eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y).
- Removed airbnb configs in favor of using default recommended rules to greatly simplify. Recommended rule sets have also gotten really good over time.
- Removed prettier plugin and config in favor of using prettier directly, which is their recommendation.
