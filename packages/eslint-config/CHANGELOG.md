# @wesp-up/eslint-config

## 1.0.1 (2024-02-14)

### Patch Changes

- Removed `imports` from `plugins` due to it already being included by `airbnb-base`. This caused a conflict with an error that looks like this: `ESLint couldn't determine the plugin "import" uniquely.` 

## 1.0.0 (2023-11-25)

### Major Changes

- Initial release
